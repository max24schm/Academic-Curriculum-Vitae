## Professional Memberships and Research Interests:

### Student membership in the Association for Psychological Science
Dec 2019 – Present 

### Social psychological perspectives on ostracism and applied social psychology: 
What factors determine whether individuals with specific attributes are more vulnerable or resilient when they are subject to ostracism? How can we employ social psychological constructs and models profitably for society (including education systems, businesses and organizations, and in peoples’ private lives)?

### Statistical and methodological advancements in psychological science: 
How can we develop appropriate standards for statistical analyses and by what means can we promote good scientific practice? What should be our general guidelines and to what extent should we grant exceptions to the standard rules for specific fields? 

### Biological foundations of human behaviour and thought: 
Besides the underlying neuronal mechanisms of human cognition, I am also interested in the further study of biological human responses to stimuli that influence their inner and outer emotional state and their mind.

## Volunteer Work:
