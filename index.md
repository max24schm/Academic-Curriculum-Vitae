## Professional Memberships and Research Interests:

#### Student membership in the Association for Psychological Science
Dec 2019 – Present

#### Social psychological perspectives on fairness, stereotypes and applied social psychology:
How is the perception of fairness influenced by stereotypes and what differences are there between people from different societal groups? How can we employ social psychological constructs and models profitably for society? How can psychology help inform politics on global issues like the climate emergency, social policies or integration?

#### Statistical and methodological advancements in psychological science:
How can we develop appropriate standards for statistical analyses and by what means can we promote good scientific practice? What should be our general guidelines and to what extent should we grant exceptions to the standard rules for specific fields?

#### Biological foundations of human behaviour and thought:
Besides the underlying neuronal mechanisms of human cognition and their evolutionary backround, I am also interested in the further study of psychophysiological responses of humans to emotional stimuli that influence their decision making.
